# Books App

A NextJS front-end for the Books Repo

To build and run the project, run 'docker-compose up --build' from the project root

Navigate to http://localhost:3001/books with the books-api project running, and if you've run the migrations and seeders, you should see the listing of example books

From here, you can create a new book using the 'Add new book' button, choose 'View' on an entry to see its details, and 'Edit' to change and update an entry.
